# NawyOrders PWA

The Progressive Web App frontend for the NawyOrders platform.

## Stack

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Arabic-first RTL interface using Noto Kufi Arabic
- NawyOrders navy, coral, and cream theme
- Web App Manifest and service worker offline fallback

## Getting started

Use Node.js 20.9 or later, then install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The service worker is registered in production builds only; use `npm run build` followed by `npm start` to try the offline fallback locally.

## Project structure

  sw.js               Service worker and offline navigation fallback

  styles/             Shared motion styles
  types/              Shared TypeScript types
```

The sample menu links to `/item/burger-baladi`. Item quantity, size, toppings, and notes are saved as a cart line in local storage when the add-to-cart button is pressed. Add routes under `src/app`, reusable components under `src/components`, and shared helpers under `src/lib`.
